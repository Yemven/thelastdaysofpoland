 POLITICS_GRZEGORZ_SCHETYNA_DESC:0 "There are people whose destiny is to always be second. Grzegorz Schetyna is one of them. \n\nStarting as an anticommunist, liberal oppositionist, Schetyna made himself comfortable in Third Polish Republic’s politics as a Lower Silesian backbone of the Civic Platform. Donald Tusk found his talents useful and took a liking in him. Having become his right-hand, Schetyna kept the party in shape and enjoyed power flowing from the future Emperor’s authority. Then the tides turned. Tusk departed to Brussels, and Schetyna took his mantle, failing miserably. Left on his own, he lacked resolve, and proved to be a spineless leader. The Platform was shaken, and PiS exploited that to the fullest. \n\nThe fault often lies on both sides, so would symetrist say. Schetyna knows this all too well. Along with Tusk he clamored for EU intervention, and when it happened, he knew that, despite all his faults, his boss had no one else he could rely upon as much as him – for without Tusk, Schetyna was nothing. Delegated to Lower Silesia, he nominally became the second Eurokommissar; in fact, however, he is barely Tusk’s ersatz for territories deemed less important than Westpommern. \n\nEagerly waiting for guidelines from Myślibórz and Brussels, Schetyna does not act much on his own. Being seen by the Poles as a despicable laughingstock, he tries at least not to become one for the Europeans – therefore, he allows army and European politicians to act on their own. With factionalism and bickering among the elites, the masses rumble, and another collapse seems imminent. If Schetyna won’t get his shit together, his name will forever be synonymous with failure."

unification.45.desc:0 "Many water has flew through Odra river after collapse of Eurokommisariat. Few polish believed that this strange german occupation state would stay alive, let alone reunite Lower Silesia. However, Poles loyal to the leadership from the West, no matter if rightly so, showed enormous enthusiasm and effort in the fight for the former Piast lands.\n\n Grzegorz Schetyna, right-hand of the head of the PO party, now unquestionable leader of EKS, has become the main quarterback in the region. As a trusted man in Brussels, he was placed in the manager of Lower Silesia, which was less important than Pomerania and Wartheland for Germany. Despite this, having less influence and manpower  and questionable loyal vassals, he managed to lead the Polish-German forces to victory. EU officials come by train to take up important administrative positions. Now three flags are waving again at the Breslau town hall, only one is slightly above them..."

eksrozpadnews.1.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]A Mutiny in Żagań!"
eksrozpadnews.1.desc:0 "What at first seemed like mere overtly optimistic hearsay has now been practically confirmed - the Eurokommissariats have begun to crumble, with the Polish 11th Armoured Cavalry Division being the first part of the European occupational army that completely broke off from the EK government. The leader of the unit - General Piotr Trytek - publicly declared that he will no longer serve under the 'pathological European regime'. \n- In these dire and awful times, we - as Poles - should stick together and put an end to arms dealing and illegal German settlement in the occupied areas together. Poland has not yet perished! - said Trytek in a message broadcasted from a captured radio station in Żagań. It is unknown if the German rule will try to retaliate, as for now no troops have been organised against the mutineers. Is it because the administration knows their sins and considers the mutiny as somehow deserved? Or because the European military is preparing against the unrest in the rest of the Kommissariats?"
