unification.57.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Alcoholy State unifies Lower Silesia"
unification.57.desc:0 "Disturbing reports are coming from Wrocław. All of Lower Silesia was united by terrocommandos of the Alcoholy State - a military junta of alcoholic under the leadership of Generalissimo Czak Noris - a man with a powerful body and even greater political power. The last points of resistance are brutally suppressed. The state enforces its authoritarian alcoholic-caste doctrine by any means, including terrorism and repressions on massive scale.\n After the alcoholics from Świdnica and Dzierżoniów split into two groups, Czak's fighters came out as the weaker and smaller, but also the fiercer one, whose radicalism contributed to their victory. Now comes the time for them to take revenge and consolidate their dominion so that no one chooses to oppose them again."
