unification.26.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Duchy of Beuthen unifies Upper Silesia!"
unification.26.desc:0 "The past never lets go. Not quite. The German history of Silesia is very rich, and therefore very nostalgic for the descendants of those expelled from these lands. But also the current inhabitants of Silesia relate with unknown sympathy to the past, when the Germans ruled in Silesia and brought order and stability.\n\nThis can be seen, for example, in the case of Bytom and Count von Schaffgotsch, who, adored by his subordinates - both Polish, Silesian and German, took over the entire Upper Silesia for ownership, and now many descendants of landowners and entrepreneurs return to their rightful lands. Will Poles once again play the role of colonial slaves exploited by German capital? Not necessarily, because the count is a very popular ruler in these lands, and definitely more popular than any Polish ruler so far."
unification.26.a:0 "Schlesien is Deutsch!"
