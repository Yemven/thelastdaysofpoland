POLITICS_POROSHENKO_DESC:0 "A television magnate whose political campaign got derailed by a media outlet, a Chocolate King who also happens to be diabetic and a corrupt populist embroiled in multiple scandals who still enjoys plenty of popularity among the Ukrainian public. In other words - Poroshenko. \n\nPoroshenko experienced war for the first time during his presidency. The reorganization of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and beginning of Ukraine's integration with the European Union briefly upped his reputation amongst the people, but that still didn't manage to save him from having to escape from his own contry after losing the 2019 elections to a guy who played on a piano with his dick on TV. \n\nAnd yet, he still returned to fight the Russians. \n\nPerhaps he shouldn't have, as it was him personally taking part in fighting the Russian invasion that ultimately sparked the idea of planting him as the head of the Ukrainian Humanitarian Mission in Poland. Initially, Poroshenko thought of this as of a reward for his service to Ukraine, but now that half of his contingent mutinied against him and the UA government after Braun's twats stuck a dagger into the Ukrainian Mission's back and pissed off the informal leadership of the Donbas veterans serving in the UHR that just so happened to be made up of Azov hardliners - all of this starts to feel like a ruse orchestrated by Zelensky to finally get rid of him for good. And he still has to receive orders from him, since his forces are formed up of Ukrainian Army troops. For now, on government orders, his remaining forces have moved back and barricaded themselves in Medyka, unsure how to feel about having to defend themselves from those who fought so hard for his country. On one hand - they're their brothers-in-arms with whom they've fought countless battles against the Russian invaders. On the other hand - they're mutiniers who went rogue against their homeland's orders to exact revenge on the Poles for Braun's actions despite their help during the war with Russia, and with Zelensky deciding that it's safer to leave Poland to her own devices... \n\n...Poroshenko might have to go rogue himself to *save them* instead."
