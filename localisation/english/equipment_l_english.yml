 melee_equipment:0 "Melee Equipment"
 melee_equipment_desc:0 "Category of equipment including weapons and tools that find their use in warzones - shovels, knives, picks and clubs to dig holes in earth and in enemy skulls."
 melee_equipment_0: "Found & Selfmade Melee Weapons"
 melee_equipment_0_desc:0 "Baseball bats, kitchen knives, batons, knuckledusters, metal pipes, garden tools, glass shivs, etc. - anything that can be found in a house, a warehouse, an abandoned kiosk, in your grandpa's garden or made with your own hands. Not very sophisticated, nor very useful against someone with a gun."
 melee_equipment_1: "Standardized Old Melee Weapons"
 melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "Found machetes, axes, tools and hunting knives that could be used in an army, renovated and standardized across our ranks, so that our sappers no longer have to dig with sticks and soup spoons."
 melee_equipment_2: "Purpose-Made Melee Weapons"
 melee_equipment_2_desc:0 "Tools and melee weapons designed in mind with urban and trench combat. Slightly reminiscent of WW1 trench weaponry."
 melee_equipment_3: "Army Melee Equipment"
 melee_equipment_3_desc:0 "Knives, shovels and other equipment that whould serve well in a modern army, with an additional renovated antique saber or shovel thrown in here and there among melee stormtroopers, just to make your ancestors extra proud."
 melee_equipment_4: "Top-Quality Melee Equipment"
 melee_equipment_4_desc:0 "Top notch modern military melee equipment that looks straight out of an American shop for knife enthusiasts. All multi-purpose, all cold to the touch, all black as death in colour (with cool white finishes near the edges)."
#melee upgrady
 melee_weapons_upgrade:0 "Serrations"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_desc:"In post-Fall Poland, brute strength is the be-all, end-all argument. No one cares about the rules of war - everyone is an acceptable casualty. Especially since people die left and right even outside of battle, due to the lack of medical goods and infrastructure. The only way to avoid death here is to play dirty, and speaking of "dirty": all these rusty knives and tools lying around could come in handy, especially with some new teeth carved onto their blades."
 melee_weapons_upgrade_1:0 "Proper Refurbishment & Maintenance"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_1_desc:0 "Our soldats have received weapons matching their role. They've been properly refurbished - they're theirs now, so they need to last for long and be in good condition. By giving our troops a basic rundown of how to maintain them and providing army-wide access to equipment such as grit paper, sharpening stones and heavy-duty tape we can ensure that their weapons won't snap in half or turn out to be completely blunt while they try to batter someone down with them."
 melee_weapons_upgrade_2:0 "Hand-to-Hand Combat Training"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_2_desc:0 "Stabbing without getting stabbed back. Pacifying enemy combatants with a single baton hit to the head. Taking accurate axes swings at enemies. Studying the blade. \n\nBy training our close quarter divisions the art of hand-to-hand combat we ensure that when two bunches of brutes meet on the battlefield, the bunch of brutes that belongs to us will come out on top."
 melee_weapons_upgrade_3:0 "Safe Engagement Tactics"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_3_desc:0 "As all rabble armies and bandit groups evolved into proper armies, guns became a mainstay on Polish battlefields. If we are to continue using troops dedicated for point-blank range combat, we have to engineer tactics that will allow our men to close the distance between them and enemies without taking 20 bullets to the face first."
 melee_weapons_upgrade_4:0 "CQC Mastery"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_4_desc:0 "We have mastered urban close quarters combat thanks to a confluence of innovative infiltration of enemy positions and skillful positioning and movement. Cunning and deadly effective, our melee-oriented stormtroopers are able to uphold and penetrate any city defense lines with ease."

 ranged_equipment_1:0 "Traumatic Weapons"
 ranged_equipment_1_desc:0 "Found or homemade traumatic weapons and BB guns. While using them in combat might feel silly, they might give you some edge over a bloke with a knife."
 ranged_equipment_2:0 "Makeshift Firearms"
 ranged_equipment_2_desc:0 "Homemade pipe shotguns and Bren- and Błyskawica-style SMGs. Just holding these in your hands makes you feel like a Warsaw resistance fighter."
 ranged_equipment_3:0 "Cold War-Era Firearms"
 ranged_equipment_3_desc:0 "Good ol' AKs and AK derivatives, along with other weapons commonly sold on the black market. While quite unwieldy in comparison to modern firearms, they more than make up for their weight and recoil with how easy they are to clean and maintain."
 ranged_equipment_4:0 "Modern Firearms"
 ranged_equipment_4_desc:0 "Rifles, carbines and LMGs used by most European armies. Now you only need to slap some underbarrel grenade launchers and red dots on it to top it off."

 ranged_equipment_5_desc:0 "Modern weapons with commonly available, standardized weapon attachments, on par with French and British pew-pews."
#ranged upgrady
 ranged_weapons_upgrade:0 "Weapons Of Ye Olden Days"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade_desc:0 "We lack guns, and we have to resort to using the simplest, most primitive ways to kill people from afar - that's why we should adopt the weaponry of our ancestors: bows, crossbows, slings and javelins - weapons that are easy to manufacture without industrial tools, yet can still kill and provide leverage over people armed with just shovels and bayonets."
 ranged_weapons_upgrade1:0 "Homemade Riot Shotguns"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade1_desc:0 "Traumatic weapons lack the range and stopping power of conventional firearms, reducing their usefulness outside of close quarter encounters. While we can't do too much about their effective range, we can, for example, adapt them to be used specifically at short-to-mid ranges and simply add more pellets per shot to increase their stopping power. Because as we all know - if a problem can't be solved by using a gun, then the best way to deal with it is to use MORE gun. \n\nMore shot, actually."
 ranged_weapons_upgrade2:0 "Safety Standards"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade2_desc:0 "It's understandably hard to make functioning guns with nothing but springs and pipes in barns and basements, but we should still include some standards of safety for our weapons so that they don't explode in our hands just because a small breadcrumb made its way into the chamber."
 ranged_weapons_upgrade3:0 "Cold War-Era Vision Equipment"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade3_desc:0 "We may have the weapons to conduct larger scale warfare, but we still lack the technology for it. Small-scale adoption of old, Soviet-era scopes, night vision and thermal vision equipment, as well as other devices used for tracking movement and viewing enemy positions could help us out in that department. Just don't use this stuff to spy on them while they're showering, please."
 ranged_weapons_upgrade4:0 "Special Ammo Types"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade4_desc:0 "One of the benefits of weapons from later NATO days is the standarization of calibers across weapon of the same type. Thanks to the fact that the same bullets match most guns in one unit, we can much more comfortably implement special ammo types into our army, as we no longer have to buy 20 different calibers serving the exact same purpose."

 infantry_training:0 "Rudimentary Infantry Training"
 infantry_training_desc:0 "'Jump, do ten squats, get down and give me twenty.' -- the most basic physical training that prepares our boys for action."
 infantry_training1:0 "Basic Infantry Training"
 infantry_training1_desc:0 "Teaching how to provide first aid to fallen teammates and going through most basic battle tactics will sharply increase survivability of our troops and is the first step towards shaping them into a real army, instead of the more or less organized mob they currently are."
 infantry_training2:0 "Advanced Infantry Training"
 infantry_training2_desc:0 "An extremely effective and important way of training our soldiers' reflexes, aim and independent thinking in the heat of action is to set them off against each other in very intensive and painful paintball matches. Before implementing this system, we simply unloaded entire mags of paint balls at them."
 infantry_training3:0 "Advanced Infantry Training II"
 infantry_training3_desc:0 "Physical and mental training that ensures our men don't snap under the harsh realities of post-Fall combat."
 infantry_training4:0 "Advanced Infantry Training III"
 infantry_training4_desc:0 "Army command and warfare techniques that simultaneously prepare us for large-scale combat and don't neglect our experiences and ability to defend against guerilla tactics used against smaller warlord cliques."
 infantry_training5:0 "Advanced Infantry Training IV"
 infantry_training5_desc:0 "Ex-NATO-inspired methods of training armies, with improvements based on our own experiences in the Polish Civil War. With top-tier training like this and so much army experience, our enemies can count on us that we will be ready. We will be effective. We will be deadly. If a joint European-Russian invasion was to be launched, if the walls were to come crashing down - we'll make it through. We will fight back. And FINALLY...   perhaps FINALLY our soldiers will learn that '4' in Roman numerals is written as 'IV', not 'IIII'."

 equipment_vests_0:0 "Random Found Clothes"

 infantry_armor1:0 "Found Protective Equipment"
 infantry_armor1_desc:0 "Found knee pads, elbow pads, bike and motorcycle helmets, etc. Won't protect you from a knife, but at least you won't scratch your knees if you fall to the floor after getting stabbed."
 infantry_armor2:0 "Improvised Protective Plates"
 infantry_armor2_desc:0 "Metal plates meant to (partially) protect from melee weapons and shrapnel. Not as cool as WW1 full metal armors, but more effective and way easier to wear." 
 infantry_armor3:0 "Flak Vests"
 infantry_armor3_desc:0 "Body armor protecting against case fragments from high-explosive weaponry, like grenade fragments or anti-aircraft flak. Won't protect you from a bullet, though."
 infantry_armor4:0 "Ballistic Vests"
 infantry_armor4_desc:0 "Simpler, usually older ballistic vests that ensure survival of their user in an unfortunate frontal meetup with a bullet."
 infantry_armor5:0 "Advanced Ballistic Vests"
 infantry_armor5_desc:0 "Highest-quality vests that are both light AND very protective. A Navy SEAL whould gladly wear one of those in combat."
#wdzianka - dolna gałąź
 equipment_vests_1:0 "Semi-Standardized Found Uniforms"
 equipment_vests_1_desc:0 "Anything covered in camo patterns, from hoodies and boxer shorts to old army and scout uniforms. Most of them don't fit, have holes in them and aren't actually designed for combat."
 camouflage_upgrade1:0 "Matching Sizes"
 camouflage_upgrade1_desc:0 "It's hard to run and shoot in uniforms and boots that are two sizes too small. We're better off sacrificing some extra time to find clothes that actually fit their wearer before handing them over to our soldiers. At least they'll no longer have the excuse that they can't march because their shoes are too tiny for their feet."
 equipment_vests_2:0 "Uniforms w/ Standard Camouflage Patterns"
 equipment_vests_2_desc:0 "Most of the camo patterns we've been using so far were based off of civilian, mil themed products that aren't actually viable for camouflage. Instead, we should re-adapt old camouflage patterns that we're actually designed for combat and tested in practice."
 camouflage_upgrade2:0 "Better Materials & Sewing Methods"
 camouflage_upgrade2_desc:0 "As our army evolves, its equipment has to evolve as well. We now possess enough resources to replace the uniforms our army was using so far with ones made from newer, much more comfortable, durable and fireproof materials and sewing methods - because a comfy soldier is a loyal soldier."
 equipment_vests_3:0 "Uniforms w/ Modern Camo Patterns"
 equipment_vests_3_desc:0 "We shouldn't still cling to old, pre-Fall camo designs that probably still remember the Soviet Union when we have the means to design better, more advanced ones - like the ones used by modern armies."

 special_forces_training2:0 "Advanced Special Forces Training" 
 special_forces_training2_desc:0 "Training of battle techniques employed by men from the harshiest regions and toughest units. Our mountaineers will shoot from around rocks and rough peaks like the Taliban, our forest specialists and guerillas will hide like the Vietcong, our marines will take the most fortified coasts like tsunami waves and our paratroopers will land safe and sound."

 special_forces_quantity1:0 "Survivalism" 
 special_forces_quantity1_desc:0 "It's hard to provide supplies to units whose job is to take the hardest fights onto themselves or to hide in mountains and forests. If we are to upkeep so many people in our special battalions, then we have to teach them how to forage and steal food from the local populace, or potentially even how to survive a day or two on an empty stomach." 
 special_forces_quantity3:0 "Regional Pride" 
 special_forces_quantity3_desc:0 "Bersaglieri, arditi, gurkhas - these are some examples of well known regional troops, serving as sources of regional pride for their homelands, and speaking of pride - nationalism and pride are some of the most easy to exploit feelings that have been used for centuries by different governments to lure people to serve in their armies. By capitalizing on regional sentimentalisms amongst our montane, forest and seaside populations we can form a new identity of speciality and servitude to the state, upon which we can build myths, legends and hearsay that will bring in hundreds of new recruits wishing to live up to their local heroes' names."
#quality
 special_forces_quality:0 "Regional Enlistment" 
 special_forces_quality_desc:0 "As our borders widen, so does our landscape diversity - why spend additional time and resources on turning Warszawiaks or other city dwellers into mountaineers, forest skirmishers and marine troops when we can seek recruits amongst villagers that already occupy specific terrain? This additional bit of experience with living in less optimal conditions or straight up survivalism will come in handy if we want to create a truly elite force. \n\n"

 inf_antitank_upgrade1_short:0 "APCR Rounds"

 inf_antitank_upgrade2_short:0 "HEAT Missiles"

You CAN, however, turn it into an improvised 4x4 with the suspension of a buggy (and then attempt 50)."
 nsb_armored_car_2:0 "Improved Armor Designs"
 nsb_armored_car_2_desc:0 "Shells, molotovs and grenades continue to be a major pain in the ass for our vehicles. As such, we need to adapt our armor designs to handle these dangers more easily."

 nsb_armored_car_3_desc:0 "We've shifted from modded civilian cars to proper military recon vehicles, and now it's also time to completely move on from mounting infantry weapons onto our armored vehicles - it's time to start integrating modern weapon systems into our vehiclar forces."

 nsb_armored_car_4_desc:0 "The types of recon vehicles we buy from abroad can vary from standard, bulky armored vehicles to riot control vehicles and even heavily armored jeeps equiped with integrated weapon systems that units wanted to get rid of in exchange for some money. These lighter, more car-like armored cars get completely wrecked by any artillery projectiles and explosive weapons, thus we need to outfit them with additional anti-armor weaponry and anti-explosive protection measures to allow them to more easily operate in the vicinity of enemy armor."

In the meantime, the West started adding AT rocket systems and unmanned gun turrets to their APCs. \nCopied Rosomaks, Partia AMVs and other, foreign designs, like the BTR-90, Boxer, Saur 1s, FNSS Pars and other whatnot."
