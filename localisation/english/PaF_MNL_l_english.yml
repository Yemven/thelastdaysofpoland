unification.58.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Community Of Owl Mountains Unites Lower Silesia"
unification.58.desc:0 "Very strange news come from the land of Lower Silesia. The area was completely taken over by Community of Owl Mountains - a strange state of loosely connected communes of alcohol lovers. There is already a smell of liqour in Wrocław, which will probably stay in the air for a long time.\n\nThe man in charge is legend and myth called Piston, who after a great split in the alcoholic country took his most faithful people and headed north, leaving hateful traitors behind. His traditional doctrine was utopian, but he nevertheless managed to get where it is now. With so little codification and enforcement of rights, it can be difficult for community to maintain power in such an area, but perhaps the polish nectar of power and peace will be the binder that will connect everyone together."
unification.58.a:0 "Let's have a drink to that!"
