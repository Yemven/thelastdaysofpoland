sapek.1.desc:0 "In the year of our Lord 2025 the world did not end. Even though many things indicated it will. Men became wolves to one another, and great calamities have fallen upon them. The Wormwood Star fell from the heavens and poisoned a third of the land and of the waters. \n\nBut it was fun anyway. \n\nAndrzej Sapkowski stood up and adjusted the map on the wall of his „innermost private ducal chamber”, that is, the toilet. The parchment was torn and bleaked from constant redrawing and erasing of borders between warlords, up to a point when the duke simply moved it to a place more appropriate. The lines and labels have changed so many times Sapkowski considered whether not to simply wrap up the worn out Poland and flush it down. It soon will be yet another work of fiction. \n\nTruth be told, that's how everything seemed recently. As if the fate of Poland fell into hands of a whole bunch of terrible writers, spitting out pages and pages of their kitschy, badly-written political and ideological fantasies. Naturally you shouldn’t blame people for retreating into fiction when things go south, but there’s escapism and then there are warlords. It’s not an issue that people die in the name of fiction – they’ve done it a lot – but let it be a good fiction, at least. \n\nThus, the Duke wrangled his fame and contacts, and voila – Ellander was born. Its mother was self-preservation, while lust of power and money was the father paying regular alimony. Not the worst place to be, until someone – in this case synonymous with anyone – comes knocking with a real army. \n\nBut for now – Sapkowski thought while washing hands – let the people enjoy the moment. Let them be glad they’re living in a fantasy or just still living, whatever. The storm has yet to begin."

sapek.2.desc:0 "– Oh, Lord, your ways are strange indeed – muttered, praying, Jacek Bartyzel. His whispers echoed through the dome of the church, audible only to God and His Mother, as Bartyzel ordered to make the temple a restricted zone while he was conversing with the Almighty about the precarious situation he found himself in. \n\nMonarchy is, as every Catholic should know, the God-ordained form of government. It is the only barrier reliable enough to defend against moral corruption and communism. That is what Bartyzel believed, although during his years in PRL and the III Republic he witnessed how monarchic ideas faded even further into oblivion and he even began thinking the cause might be lost. But God took notice and sent calamities and Anarchy as a divine punishment reminding of the right way. A problem appeared, however – no legitimate pretender would be willing in their right mind to devote themself to a broken country. Where should the monarch come from, then? Indecisive and isolated, the monarchists made a bid for power, but they quickly found out they’ve bitten off more than they could chew. \n\nSapkowski’s rise to power reminded Bartyzel of the legends told about barbarian kings from the dawn of Christian Europe. True, he’s quite godless, and many of his supporters are outright blasphemous, but have things like that stopped the Word of God for long? Bartyzel put his pride on a shelf and offered his support to the Duke. This proved a deciding factor in stabilizing the realm and keeping its borders safe. \n\nIn time the ways of the Lord will straighten. Meanwhile, Bartyzel hones his supporters into an effective, loyal and zealous paramilitary, ready to uphold the tradition of true monarchism. Conventionally named the Order of the White Rose, it has become a home for all those sympathizing with the right. For now Bartyzel, as the Grandmaster of the Order, still has to tread carefully, but when the time is right, he might be strong enough to present the throne as an offering to a more respectable, worthy and virtuous monarch. \n\n– So help me God –  he concluded, rising from the church floor and heading towards the exit."

They are a disorganized mob, and either we deal with them like one should with brigands, or they’ll act like the ones in our lands. \nSome of the council members whispered angrily. This will anger our subjects, they said. Piekara prepared for a response, but Ziemiański interrupted him. \n– It’s better not to make any enemies just as our reign has solidified. Maribor fights with gold, and that weapon will prove deadly to us, if we engage our forces carelessly. \n\n – When it comes to my opinion – Sapkowski leaned over the map – I am concerned with what happens in Wyzima. They’ve elected a „king” from among their own. This city is lawless, and ripe with crime, debauchery and whoring. We can’t leave our capital in that state. \n– These are the words of wisdom, my liege! – Bartyzel proclaimed, as his supporters clapped and nodded in an overtly enthusiastic manner. – We surely could find an ally in the Brotherhood of Bełcha... I mean Mahakam. I can reach out to them for aid. \n\n – Let us not reveal that we’re the first ones asking for help – Sapkowski replied. – For now, all I wanted is to know your opinion, and with that knowledge I’ll take a bit of time to ponder over – his  face grimaced as if he was mocking someone – our politics. But you, sir Jacek – he nodded to Dukaj – you haven’t voiced your opinion yet. \n– I don’t think there’s any point in seeking conflict now, my liege. It’s going to find us soon enough."

The constabulary was put on alert immediately after the explosion was heard, but just a few minutes later the town square was filled with the rattle of machine guns. A few high-speed, pocket-size technicals have broken into the city, aiming at windows and passersby and throwing grenades through broken glass. The constable, fearing this is an attempt on the Duke’s life, sent a large detachment to guard the ducal palace, ordering the rest to block the streets and attempt to surround the technicals. \n\nMeanwhile, the facility burned. The attackers showered disoriented guards with furious fire, spreading sheer terror through the premises. While they fought, another detachment of technicals rode through the western breach, aiming straight for the laboratories and warehouses. Men clad in balaclavas got off them and in a blink of an eye reached the most coveted secrets of Duchy’s wizards. Overwhelming the few remaining guards, they begun lading technicals with testing vials, newly-devised concoctions and strongboxes containing the recipes. \n\nJust as the Director tried to make one more call, one of the raiders broke into his room and stabbed his back, howling stridently in bloody rage. The wizard fell to the floor, seeing as the fiery glow overtook the sky behind the windows. Screams, both frenzied and terrified along with thunderous explosions came from the city."

The crowd making itself scarce was the worst of it all: Many figured they'd pack up their things. Enough of their carts could clog up the streets, which would pose trouble for city guard out to get the fire under control. Of course, with most fire engines out of commission, the limited guards and the military were understength. Priorities had to be made: Many a brother was seen in burning church, or stables, and had to be saved, him and the horses.

Then they went on about human casualties, but Sapkowski's ears checked out already. His thoughts were a tornado that swept the clowns around him away, and he and his plans were in its eye.

We looked everywhere a salamander could hide in: Damp creeks, tanning beds, these reptiles just can't be found.' \n Sapkowski went red like when he asked CDP Red for his money back per Law of Surprise (right?), got a whole barrel of vodka instead and next thing he knew he was brewing a new deal with that nice lady from Netflix. \n 'Amphibians' - he muttered. \n '...the fuck?' - the PFI vanguard was clearly off guard as he let his boorish default speech into the radio - 'I mean, pardon me m'lord?' \n 'SALAMANDERS ARE AMPHIBIANS.' - he screamed and cut off the connection, slamming the telephone.

We are now faced with a difficult decision. We must choose where to build the new seat for the Order of the White Rose, a decision that will have serious political implications.\n\nThe first option is to rebuild the ruins in Łowicz, a location with a rich history and strong cultural ties. However, this choice could be seen as a blatant attempt to reclaim the past and could be met with resistance from those who do not support the Order's ideals. It seems most neutral in terms of influence of Order's control over internal politics of Ellander.\n\nThe second option is to rebuild a palace at Bedlno, a location with fewer historical ties. While this choice may be less controversial, it could also be seen as lacking in the grandeur and gravitas that the order aims to project. Besides, sending them to some god-forsaken village may look for them like an offence, and Bartyzel won't certainly like having to drive his old car through those abandoned roads.\n\nThe third option is to build the seat at Pałacyk Myśliwski in Kaer Nevitz, a location that is relatively neutral and has the added benefit of being close to Sapkowski's own residence. But this actually may be the most dangerous option, as convenient as it might look. Distance from Royal Castle to Order's seat would be few minutes at least.

It was a disheartening sight: the soldiers seemed completely lost, their movements uncoordinated and their expressions panicked.\n- What the hell is going on here?! - shouted the instructor, a grizzled veteran with a short fuse. - You call yourselves soldiers? You're a goddamn embarrassment!\nThe soldiers flinched at the instructor's words, their faces reddening with shame. Pudzianowski could see the fear in their eyes, and he knew that they were in over their heads.\n- Come on, get your act together! - the instructor continued, his voice laced with frustration. - You need to be ready for battle, not stumbling around like a bunch of newborn foals!\n\nPudzianowski couldn't stand the sight of this any longer. He marched down onto the training ground and approached the soldiers.\n- Listen up, men - he said, his voice stern. - I know you're all feeling lost and unsure of yourselves. But I've got a secret for you: the key to winning a fight isn't about strength or size. It's about strategy, technique and morale, you can't sell yourself cheap!\nThe soldiers looked at Pudzianowski with interest, their expressions turning from fearful to hopeful.\n- I'm going to show you how to fight like I do - he continued - We'll start with the basics of boxing and go from there. By the time we're finished, you'll all be ready to take on the enemy and live to tell the tale.\nAnd with that, Pudzianowski began to demonstrate the moves and techniques of boxing, showing the soldiers how to use their bodies as weapons and fight with precision and grace. It was a far cry from the haphazard training they had been subjected to before, and the soldiers responded with enthusiasm and determination.\nAs he left the training ground, Chief of War couldn't help but feel proud of the progress he had seen. He knew that these soldiers still had a long way to go, but he was confident that they would be ready for at least a stray dog."

Besides him, the rest of the council sat around the debate table in the castle, led by the duke. It also included Archmage Jacek Dukaj, Grand Architect Andrzej Ziemiański, and Grand Inquisitor Jacek Piekara, all clearly disgusted by the vulgar behavior of their military commander.\n- I assure you, sir, there is no need to get carried away. The situation is completely under control - said Dukaj, at which Ziemiański raised his head and looked sharply at the archmage.\n- Under control!? You don't even control the characters in your scribbles you call novels! A mediocre comedy at its best, and you call yourself a fantasy writer?\n- Well, yes, one brute defends another brute, go throw a few more curses, it will definitely make your work more wonderful. Maybe you should seriously take the autobahn to Poznan and spare us your "talent" - Dukaj replied gruffly.\n\nIn the meantime, the Grand Inquisitor did nothing but look contemptuously from one to the other and made brief notes in his journal, thinking about how much he would like to bring this entire Council to his tribunal. Sapkowski didn't even have to write anything down. And he wasn't even looking at them. It was as if he wasn't listening to them either, he was completely disconnected from reality. But this stone form was only a facade, the Duke absorbing every sound and with every word spoken, calculating on whom his wrath would fall.

When they found him, he didn't even resist, it was no use. They brought him to a dark cell under the castle, where he expected that the most he could hope for was some racist thug who will beat him to a pulp. But he saw two figures who made even his cold and merciless deeds in the forests of Łowicz fade away in the face of the authority represented by them - Andrzej Sapkowski and his chief inquisitor, Jacek Piekara.\n\n- Gentlemen, all that's missing is a red carpet and some paparazzi, you know... I think I'm blushing. - aep Clag, despite his internal anxiety, continued to make the appearance of a comedian who can pierce you with both an arrow and his sharp gaze at any moment.\n- One more joke and I'll really have you fed your own feces - the inquisitor cut off the conversation. - Now, finally, tell us why we observed suspicious increased Scoia'tael activity near the border with the Consortium a few weeks before the attack on Kaer Nevitz?"\n- Ah, you know, we went mushroom picking. The chanterelles are really good this year. Listen, Jaca - you really think we'd shit in our own nest? You have no evidence. If you had, the forests would already be on fire. And you won't have them, because we had nothing to do with the Salamander. But keep treating us like this and maybe we'll remember that there are others out there who want to destroy you! - Seasar went from joking to an angry outburst in no time.

Its target was the former church of St. James the Apostle, now converted into a temple of the Eternal Fire and a key point for the Order's power in the city. The inside of the chapel was empty, and only one person was sitting in one of the front rows. The Grand Master of the Order of the White Rose, Jacek Bartyzel, was waiting for the Grand Inquisitor, giving himself up to prayer in the meantime.\nPiekara, however, could see the irony in the deeds of Bartyzel, who mockingly but perfectly fitted into the story that Sapkowski wrote for this city.\n- Which God are you praying to? - asked newcomer. He knew the answer, he just wondered if Bartyzel would dare to openly drop the act.\n- There's only one God - replied the Grand Master shortly.\n- Thought so. Would you say that to the Duke too?\n- Just you. And perhaps a few other puppets from your court.\n- So I'm a puppet? - Piekara looked hurt.\n- What did you want to meet for? - Bartyzel didn't wait for the development of events and cut to the chase.\n- I've been put in the role of lead investigator in a case of illegal diversion of funds from the Order's coffers. I also know that you don't generally treat the Duke as a sane conversation partner. Now, this Salamander thing...you understand why it's suddenly become an internal security issue? The Inquisitor seemed frightened, as if he had great respect for the Grand Master, but at the same time he was afraid of what he might do to him. Even the Duke did not inspire such fear in the land.\n- Let's pretend this conversation never happened. For your safety. - With these words, the Grand Master got up from the pew and went out into the city street which had previously been lashed with rain, and now turned into a torrent that ran along the winding paths of the city. Piekara was left to his own thoughts. He was aware of one thing too - if anyone was to be responsible for the attack - it could certainly be Bartyzel. But we can be sure as well that we will not associate him with this event for the world."

In an instant, however, he became serious and answered briefly\n- Get out.\nThe emissaries turned and headed for the exit when Rutkowski shouted to the senior messenger\n- Piotrek!

Ethics aside, codifying it into law will grant us a highly flexible and nebulous tool to procure... prospective Witchers. Such a law will produce many a weeping mother, and while from a warlord's perspective, ethics are six feet beneath the bottom of our concerns, Sapkowski's mental state does not thrive on blatant disregard for ethics.

This can be especially useful for soldiers who are expected to be deployed in rough or austere conditions, akin to ZHP partisans, as they will be better prepared to cope with the demands of such environments.

It's a pharmaceutical augmentation procedure, that can offer soldiers certain physical and cognitive enhancements that may be beneficial in certain situations. The drugs used in it, can improve soldiers' physical endurance, strength, and reflexes, at least in theory. Or enhance their ability to process information or make decisions under stress.  This is our most daring program, its experimental nature makes the possibility of addiction the least of our concerns, Many will not survive the stress of physiological change induced by them, as well as their sheer toxicity.

Pudzianowski, on the other hand, was a powerful striker, looking to keep the fight standing and wear down his opponent with hard shots.\nThe crowd cheered and gasped as the two fighters exchanged blows, each one landing solid shots that sent the other stumbling back.

The once-grand palace was never really a palace, just a city hall with furnishing that was supposed to be luxurious but was so ramshackle it could pass as a scene from Disco Elysium, a mere parody of the glory it aimed for. But the duke was used to it by now, and he barely paid it any mind as he continued.\n He used to be the author of a series of fantasy books. Now, he led an entire Duchy that lived its universe, working hard to breach the barrier between its fiction and reality. In parallel, Sapkowski struggled with separating his stories from reality.\nThe world of his books was a fantastical place, full of magic and adventure, and it was easy to get lost in. And yet… you can’t last in the real world without at least somewhat acknowledging it.\n ’There’s no strigas nor drowners nor kikimoras.

When he gets up, the moon shines red. Everything shines red. The fires consuming Vizima are all red. They devour what was left of this city’s identity. There is no… what was its name? Something silly… What was it all about? Nothing realistic. It’s all gone anyways. His forces, stressed by the combat, tear it down and burn it. Only Vizima remains. All the whoresons, were slaughtered. Only monsters remain. No one could look at the faces of all these people, dying or gone, shaded in purple, only red light and blackness to accompany that unless they mattered not. Unless this reality was the enemy. It gave us nothing but anguish, and produced a failed state, failed deals, and failed business. The success and wealth? It all came from Sakpowski’s imagination, the world he made, a better world. The worse this would be, the closer his own was. He could feel it creeping on him. Knocking down heaven’s door. He knew why it was coming. Everything he did, everyone he surrounded himself with, and all the decisions that led him here… were meant to summon it here and craft a more fantastic and terrifying story than that nice Netflix lady could ever make.\nLike the Wild Hunt, his world knocked on his mind’s door. The worse the real world was, the stronger the call was. Ever more immersed, he was into his whole regime, the regime he knew was just a ridiculous LARP, yet one that brought low a city that used to be the heart of this country’s industry… whatever its name was. The promise of liberty from the past’s mistakes… why does it feel like the greatest mistake of all?\nThe fear spikes and Sapkowski physically recoiled from it. Away from it. His life flashed before him, and he ran from it. To the world, he crafted to shield himself from it to the door he only saw ripped open, possessed by his most primal instinct."

Nilfgaard has overridden the lands beyond this failed state that was now Northern Kingdoms. And Sapkowski tried to do the same. Cross over to their world. Leave it all behind forever more.

As they approached the headquarters, the commando could see a faint light coming from one of the windows. They knew they had to act fast, before the guards was alerted to their presence. With a signal from their leader, they burst through the door, arrows knocked.\n\nThe watchmen were caught off guard, and it didn't take long for the elves to overpower them. Soon they busted through remaining floors and rounded up the remaining members of the patrol, one of their leaders approached them, a smug look on his face.\n- Well, well, well, - it was no other than the Krzysztof Rutkowski, leader of Maribor's armed forces and a commander of the Patrol - Looks like the Scoia'tael have finally decided to come out of their forest ghetto. What do you want with me?\n- You're under arrest -  the commando leader replied, as one of his team members tied the rope around Rutkowski's wrists. - For crimes against the free races of elves, dwarves and...\n- ...hobbits, fairies, and gnomes. Jesus Christ, get over it - Rutkowski sneered, but he knew he had no choice but to go along with the commando. \n\nAs they marched him out of the headquarters, the commando leader called their base to report their success and to ask what they should do with their prisoner.\n- Bring him to the Kaer Nevitz - the voice on the other end of the line replied. - Inquisition'll deal with him from there.\nThe commando nodded, satisfied that justice would be served. They were sworn enemies of inquisition but that didn't matter. They were gonna make him pay. As they led Rutkowski away, they knew that their actions tonight would be victory for every Scoia'tael soldier out there, in the mudded fields of this war. Question remained, what to do with him?

No one knew exactly what had happened to the doctor and his team, but rumors had circulated for years about strange and unsettling experiments being conducted within its walls.\nAs the soldiers cautiously entered the building, they were met with a scene of chaos and confusion. The once-sterile laboratory was now cluttered and disorganized, with broken glass and shattered equipment scattered throughout. But the most disturbing sight was the rows of human bodies that lined the walls, mutated and altered in ways that were almost unimaginable.\n\n- What on Melitele's tits is this!? - exclaimed one of the soldiers , staring in shock at a human corpse that appeared to be almost boneless.\n- Those sick fuckers... - another soldier replied, examining a dead human connected to some tubes that seemed to be inhaling some kind of medication even if host is no longer alive. - What the fuck could they have been trying to accomplish?\n- I don't know...but don't touch anything. It could be contagious.\n\nAs they explored further, they discovered more and more disturbing evidence of the experiments that had been conducted in the laboratory. It was clear that Doctor Ebrantil and his team had been engaged in unethical and potentially dangerous research, with no regard for the well-being of the people of Consortium.\nThe soldiers couldn't shake the feeling that they had only scratched the surface of the dark secrets that lay hidden within. There were a lot of bodies there, many people were slaughtered like sacrificial lambs for sick gains that seemed to be pointless, as Consortium still lost the war. Officer of the incursion team sighed and ordered: \n- What is the price of killing so many people? We must find this crazy bastard and put him down...meanwhile, shut this thing down.

They won't show them mercy, that's for sure. But nonetheless they will definitely strengthen their position in our internal politics.\nOn the other hand, Sapkowski could choose to send the Scoia'tael, a group of skilled guerilla fighters who use the same tactics as the scout partisans.

This would likely be seen as a more enlightened and progressive move, and could help to ease tensions between the Duchy and the Scoia'tael.\n\nUltimately, the decision is Sapkowski's to make, and he must weigh the pros and cons of each option carefully.

Their expressions burned with hatred, but none of them was holding a weapon.\n"If only I could get up, I could run for it." - thought the prisoner, but he couldn't even stay on his feet because his knee refused to obey.\nOne of them, wearing a wide hat, appeared to be a captain.

The kingdom's state structure has been described by local and international observers as a "Disneyland-state", using names and references to the Witcher franchise as a way to push its social liberal agenda. The clique was able to succeed thanks to an alliance with Jacek Bartyzel's Carlists, who took a liking to Sapkowski's "monarchy". Other statelets surrounding Łódź, who so far have thought of Temeria as of an interesting, albeit doomed to fail experiment, now watch it in concern, wondering if this Witcher LARP will be convincing enough for the Carlists, and whether it wasn't a little bit *too* convincing for Sapkowski himself."

A campaign to eradicate all criminals had begun all over Ellander.\n\nOn the main screen (which Duke calls "megascope") appeared a video of the action in Łowicz, where the alleged headquarters of the Syndicate was located. Only one of the bosses has been caught, but reports show that the nationwide operation has been successful, and over the next two weeks, the rest will be detected and exterminated like rats.\n\nA bit frighteningly efficient."

SAP_production_control_desc:0 "Sapkowski was happy after the destruction of the Syndicate. Like a ghoul after eating a young woman. This moral gluttony has obscured the picture of the situation, which, admittedly, removed the Syndicate from the equation, but replaced it with the White Rose.\n\nAnd they were not idle. They did not destroy the entire crime apparatus, but took it over and transformed it to their advantage. Now it is the Order that controls the flow of goods, the quality and quantity of production, and most of the trade.\n\nAnd they are VERY picky and harsh."
SAP_status_dependent_taxes:0 "Status-Dependent Taxes"
SAP_status_dependent_taxes_desc:0 "Indeed, it is strange. For the Order has just persuaded Minister Ziemiański to introduce a progressive tax. The richer you are, the more you pay. It is a bit strange considering that the majority of our country is in the lowest tax bracket, including the Scoia'tael. And it's hard to expect any remnant of the Syndicate to pay any taxes at all.\n\nSo the Order just basically penalized itself. Maybe it's such a perverse joy derived from whipping yourself? They are wicked, you know. So it wouldn't be anything out of ordinary if that was the case.\n\nOr they are just planning something worse."

It will not be very profitable for people to earn more than the wealth of an ordinary farmer. Because they won't pay out. Well, unless they decide to work for a noble Order, then they will be exempt from all taxes. But at the cost of freedom.\n\nI hear sometimes from these religious "gulags".

As long as the Syndicate politely shares the money with us and the Scoia'tael are keeping order instead of tearing it down, that's fine.

They share stories in comparison to which, the soldier Švejk looks like the bravest hero in the world, and the Russian army looks competent.\n\nDamn that Švejk, they compare us to the second army of the third world!

It's not my fault the nun wanted to listen to my soothing voice, and there was a very pissed off priest in the next room. Perhaps even the Hierarch himself...\n\nBut this sonnet! You should have seen them dash on their horses, how they fire their bows! This is pure poetry in military form! Admittedly, they don't really like being watched, they shouted something at me, so it must have been secret training. It sounded like - 'BLOEDE DHOINE' or something similar.

But there is a training plan, there are prospects for the headquarters, it just might be successful.\n\nOne thing. Witchers are monster slayers. I've always suspected that that old woman upstairs is a grave hag, and that creepy clerk from the ground floor must be a vampire ... but I'm not entirely sure if we'll find any ghouls, kikimores or wyverns here...\n\nSo what monsters are they going to hunt?"

POLITICS_ANDRZEJ_SAPKOWSKI_DESC:0 "After the collapse of the Polish state, the famous writer of the “Witcher” series  gathered loyal fans and founded his own faction in the city of Skierniewice mainly as a way of protecting himself in these chaotic times. To keep the morale of fantasy fanatics up, he decided to stylise his faction in an image of the Witcher world he created. At least that's what the cynics say, as it is also possible that the old writer has gone completely mad and his duchy is not a mere masquerade, but a genuine attempt to create a truly Temerian realm. Truth may never be revealed as the "duke" rarely speaks in public and when he does his elusive answers and dry sense of humor make it really hard to figure out what's actually on his mind."
POLITICS_JACEK_BARTYZEL_DESC:0 "Who’s to say that monarchy is dead? Bartyzel would disagree. A radical conservative, he tried to create his own catholic monarchical state in Łowicz, but failed to become one of the key players in the region due to the lack of popularity of his ideas. The situation got worse for him, when Andrzej Sapkowski arrived in the area. The writer gained wide support thanks to his fame, while the number of Bartyzel's supporters was dwindling with each passing day. Realizing his faction won't survive on his own, he swore fealty to Duke Sapkowski, promising his faithful service in exchange for the autonomous rule of the newly formed county of Łowicz. Even though he views the Duchy of Ellander as a farce, he can't deny that Sapkowski's regime is the only monarchical government, that gained traction in the lands of post-Fall Łódź Voivodeship, and because of that, he will work with Sapkowski as long as the duke respects his right to autonomous rule."
POLITICS_WLADYSLAW_BARTYZEL_DESC:0 "After much deliberation, the regency council, presided by his father, has chosen Jacek Władysław as a new King of Poland. While he had his disagreements with his father on certain political matters, he nevertheless offered him his help in governing the county of Łowicz and later he kept public support at astoundingly high levels during his father's rebellion. He may not be as conservative a carlist candidate for the throne, but he's a much safer option, as he's already well versed in warlord politics and can actually speak Polish."
POLITICS_KAROL_BURBON_DESC:0 "The current head of the House of Bourbon-Parma, as well a member of the Dutch Royal Family. He is the claimant to the defunct throne of the extinct Duchy of Parma. In addition, he is considered by some a contested claimant to the throne of Spain under the name Carlos Javier I. While he had never contested the legitimacy of the Bourbon line currently ruling in Spain, he decided to accept the offer of the Legitimist Regency Council of Poland and become a new king of the soon-to-be unified kingdom. While he's not accustomed to the brutal reality of post-Fall Poland and can't communicate with his subjects due to his unfamiliarity with their local language, his rise to power is believed to be the only for truly virtuous government within Polish lands."

SAP_sanity:0 "THE GWYNBLEIDD'S GAZE INTO HIS TEXTS"
SAP_sanity_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a land torn by disagreements, differences, and ultimately - by civil war - lives an old man, who took it upon himself to make things right. \nHe built himself a small duchy, of which he was proclaimed Duke. There, he started building a new, better world for creatures of this world to live in - one of vibrant magic, exotic cultures and fascinating peoples. \n§4And he based if all off a world he already built in the past...§!\n\n\nWelcome to the Duchy of Ellander - a state built entirely on a premise of being a Witcher-themed Disneyland, where the army, institutions, laws and even official talks, bureaucracy and terms used in inter-clique diplomacy are all themed after things from the world of Witcher, both ones already present in the books and ones that required new lore to be written for them to be fitted into the Witcher's setting. \nHere, in bureaus-made-throne rooms, Sapkowski holds public medieval courts over flamboyantly dressed feudal vassals, merchants and advisors, all to the delight of kids and fantasy enthusiasts. While this might make for fun public events, it makes for a poor system of governance - especially since even behind closed doors the Duke orders to be refered to as 'Gwynbleidd' and speaks of 'Vizimian envoys' and 'rebellious elves in the south', all without a hint of irony in his voice. \n§tFor now, the Duke's rulership continues to bring colour to the bleak lives of Poles and his rulership is thought of by most as 'a creative way of bringing constantly feuding people together'. Some, however, are cautious of how far this LARP goes and whether this still even is a LARP at all...§! \n\nTHE GWYNBLEIDD SEEKS GUIDANCE FROM HIS TEXTS ON HOW TO SHAPE HIS REALM. THEIR SETTING IS LOVED BY MANY, BUT IF HE GAZES TOO DEEP INTO THEM, HIS PERCEPTION OF REALITY MIGHT BECOME BLURRED. \nCURRENTLY, HIS GAZE REACHES §4[?sapek_sanity|=4 0] MILES DEEP§! INTO HIS TOMES.\n\n"
