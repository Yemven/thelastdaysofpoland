POLITICS_HOCHMAJSTER_DESC:0 "Catholicism, a religion and force that accompanied Polish national consciousness since its very founding, it would be hard to deny that Roman Christianity became one of the pillars of Polish society over the centuries. \n Which might at least somewhat explain the Hochmajster's rise to power, an otherwise ridiculous event. \n \n Not much is known about the Hochmajster, he mysteriously appeared during the fall of the Polish state and within weeks garnered the support of local Catholic extremists which he fashioned into a military force resembling the old Teutonic Order. \n Much is speculated on the Hochmajster's past and identity, is he a German agent sent to subjugate Poland under the guise of a Catholic order? Is he an agent of chaos who truly believes that imitating the medieval rivals of Poland is the clearest path for the country's future? Or is he just an insane larper who managed to carve out a state for himself after the collapse of order? Almost all theories end up being nothing more than baseless claims made in the face of a lack of any known information about the Order's Master and his followers in arms are zealous enough to keep his wishes for secrecy absolute."

unification.94.desc:0 "The entirety of Poland watches in disbelief as an organization claiming to continue the mission of the Teutonic Order has succeeded in their struggle to organize a state in lands of Warmia-Masuria. \n \n The "Tełtonisze Ordensztat" led by the infamous and mysterious "Hochmajster" seemed nothing more than a decrepit laughing stock, described in some cases as "fucking larpers" just a few months ago, yet by either some divine stroke of luck or by fate's divine stroke of comedy the Order has managed to beat and conquer every other power in the region, including the Russian armed remnants in Kaliningrad. \n \n Despite the state's allure to German ultranationalism and Catholic extremism, both the German Eurostaat and the Vatican have condemned the order's existence as "fascist" and "a mockery of Catholicism".\n\nNot many people expect the Order to survive for long, but who knows, fate has server absurdity before."
