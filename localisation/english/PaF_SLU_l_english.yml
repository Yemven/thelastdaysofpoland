unification.61.desc:0 "After the chaos following the collapse of Westpolen Eurokommissariat, the all-out chaos and anarchy followed, with chaos and only chaos eventually ending up banished by a state that baffles the educated pundits. The former Voivodeship is under “control” of the Poznań Slums, an anarchist commune that’s “led” by Ryszard “Peja” Andrzejewski, an accomplished rapper from Poznań. Inspired by their spokesperson’s artistry, the Slums can be best described as a society led by “tenament ideology”, as in “Living your own life and being left the hell alone”. Though insistent on being distinct from the usual political divide of left and right, the Slums are already being hailed by some at the European far-left as the advent of anarchism, if not anarcho-communism, as well as an example: the Slums are some of the more humanitarian polities compared to average Polish warlord state."
