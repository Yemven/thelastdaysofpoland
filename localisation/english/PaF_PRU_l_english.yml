POLITICS_OLA_TURKIEWICZ_DESC:0 "Ola Turkiewicz - vocalist, compositor, festival organizer, and as of recently, the leader of the neo-baltic warband that has taken over the south of Masuria. Her decision to carve out a state for the Baltic people was mainly influenced by her belief in "Pruthenian Restorationism" which advocates for the revival of the many cultures wiped out by Teutons and Poles. \n \n Though she managed to conquer a state for herself, her hardest trial has just begun as the task of establishing a functional country biased on such a controversial idea and protecting it from invaders now lies on her shoulders. She surely has the complete and utter support of the Prussians, Yatvingians, Warmians, and Masurians, but will those small isolated societies of few thousands be enough for her to compete with the massive pushback from Polish nationalists? In fact, not only are die-hard nationalists her enemies, the idea of establishing a non-polish state on Polish-soil isn't popular with.....anyone. \n \n As the curtain to peaceful coexistence is slowly falling Ola will have to contend with the responsibility of carrying the people she swore to protect through the following chaos of war, and with the possibility of failure the Baltic people might suffer the same fate they suffered hundreds of years ago."
