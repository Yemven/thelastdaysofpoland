unification.49.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Free Fishermen's Army Unites Lower Silesia"
unification.49.desc:0 "The first bit of news has flown in from Lower Silesia. A group of angler-warriors that took power in the vicinity of the Milicz ponds, managed to organize themselves into a de facto state. Whether because of luck or the incompetence of their rivals, or for some other reason, they strengthened their position in the former voivodeship.\n\nTheir leader, Andrzej Gałecki, leads his fellow anglers in the spirit of complete freedom to catch fish wherever and whenever they want. Of course, respecting the fishing positions and regular restocking and feeding of fish. Most of the authorities' offices are located along the Odra and smaller rivers, as well as in all lakes and ponds. The leader himself sails around the territory on a mighty boat, the state's flagship. The citizens are dismayed, but thanks to the lessons taught by anglers, they can quickly adapt to the reality of fishing."
unification.49.a:0 "At least they're not trawling?"
