unification.81.desc:0 "Grudziądz has always been a city closely tied to the armed forces and as the Fall caused Poland to descend into chaos, they were there to restore order. Assembling military branches from the surrounding area, forming the Grudziądz Command the army remnants have since managed to restore order first to the surrounding gminas and now to the entire Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. While the Army’s pacification of the region was seen as practically inevitable due to their comparatively immense strength, they have not been met with open hands in most places, being cited as illegitimate by the public. Despite the voices of dissent, their success is undoubtable. "
