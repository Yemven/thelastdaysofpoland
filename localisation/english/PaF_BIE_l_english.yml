unification.116.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Bielany unifies the Capital District!"
unification.116.desc:0 "Today Vocalist Podsiadło, former artist and now charismatic leader of Bielany Union of Feminists, declared in his announcement the successful seizure of all the lands of the former Capital City. \n\nThe Model country, to which Podsiadło Aspires, is built on a decentralized economy (so-called Small-Town system) and the negation of patriarchy. The Vocalist truly believes in progressive and feminist values, although in his country law enforcement duties are held by The Pink Shirts, truly ruthless and fierce militia. Not hesitant to brutally quash opposition, Podsiadło does not see a problem with installing a de facto totalitarian regime while speaking about tolerance, European values and equality. Therefore the fate of the newly conquered lands is currently unknown."
