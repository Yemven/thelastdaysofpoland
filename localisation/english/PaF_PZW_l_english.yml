unification.96.desc:0 "It seems PZW wasn't satisfied with just stealing from the most saintly symbols of Polish virtue called independent fishermen, so they stole the entire Voivodeship of Warmia-Masuria to use as a jump point in their maniacal quest to rob every last Polish and soon Baltic fisherman of their hard earned money and respect. \n \n Millions cried out in anguish as the tyrants of the Polish Angling Association came out at top of the Warmian power struggle and secured their holdings over every last body of water in the north-east. \n While most states of the fading Polish anarchy have voiced their discontent and swore to protect the average Polish fisherman there are some tyrannical warlords who plan to cooperate with the Association as a measure to reap benefits from exploiting their rivers."
