unification.18.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Częstochowa unifies Zagłębie and Jura!"
unification.18.desc:0 "God is merciful indeed. It would seem that after the death of Archbishop Depo, the stability of Częstochowa would fall and Jasna Góra would be pecked by ravens and crows. By the will of God, however, a new force has emerged that has taken power peacefully, which is an exception in this torn country. [CCH.GetLeader] is now the leader of the most enlightened and iconic church faction, which united Jura and Zagłębie, once again eradicating atheistic communism from these lands, under the protection of the Mother of God. Only the strength of God can conquer, and with him by their side, they will be undefeated.\n\nHowever, these are all official transmissions from Jasna Gora. The situation looks a lot more complicated than that. Because does the suffering of millions of people in a country forgotten by God also belong to this great plan of the Lord? There are many who will disagree and only time will tell if [CCH.GetRulingPartyLong] is up to their challenge."
