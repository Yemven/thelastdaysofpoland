 Zona_desc: "§HStare Bałuty. 23rd of August, 2025.§! \n\n§WGrażyna and her husband are enjoying their minced meatchops and watching Familiada, when suddenly - they, their dinner, their apartment block and the entire neighbourhood get wiped off the face of Earth as a second sun rises above most of the Łódź Voivodeship, causing the already dying Poland to disintegrate completely and sparking the German-led EU intervention that was meant to put the country back in charge of itself.§! \n\n...50000 people used to live here.\nNow it's a ghost town."

Bandits.§! \n\n§WAs state apparatus stopped functioning in the region, some brutes banded together and started raiding neighbouring houses and villages for money, jewelry, cars and TVs. Many followed in their footsteps, first to enrich themselves as well, then to take back what was stolen from them by others.§! §tAnd there's no sign of any evolving authority that could finally stop this practice once and for all.§!"
  Bieszczady_desc:0 "§WAhhh... the beatiful Bieszczady Mountains - a very picturesque and sparsely populated region, devoid of any infrastructure or organised authority. \n\nMost of the local population has fled abroad to Slovakia and Ukraine, their homes and farms now being overtaken by wild animals - the new rulers of this abandoned region. Patrol groups from Krosno, Lesko and Przemyśl often try to encroach on their territory only to run back home with bagged corpses of their comrades who've been mutilated by bears and wolves.§! \n\n§HAnd that's how life goes slowly, here in Bieszczady.§!"
