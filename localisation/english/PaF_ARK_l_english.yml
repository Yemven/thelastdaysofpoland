arka_exodus.1.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Departure of the Last Ark"
arka_exodus.1.desc:0 "In the past couple of days European social media have been taken by storm by pictures of... a gigantic wooden ark traversing up north across the Baltic Sea. \nThe first sighting of the ship dates to the last week, when a fisherman illegally operating near the Polish coast published a tweet containing a photo of an enormous wooden vessel the likes of Noah's Ark, bearing the logo of Arka Gdynia - a Polish football club. Soon after, more vessels from Visby reported seeing the very same ship heading vaguely towards the Swedish mainland. \nAccording to Zbigniew Rybak - the headsman of the Ark's constructors - the club has conducted a mass exodus to Sweden with the goal of returning to their country to rebuild it from the beginning once it finally stops disintegrating itself into the Dark Ages."
