unification.105.desc:0 "Rumours coming from Podlachia have come into the spotlight in recent weeks as the Agrounion, along with the Siedlice Union have together emerged victorious in the chaotic region. Podlachia has been in a near constant state of warring, the borders not having solidified as in other parts of the shattered nation. Having bid their time, letting the other warlords wear themselves out, they’ve managed to claim the area for themselves when the war finally came knocking on their doorstep. However, the Agrounion having managed not only to claim more land during the conflict, but also earining alot of support from Podlachia’s population has come out on top to be the true leader of the region, in a peaceful takeover of their former ally, something unprecedented just about anywhere in Post-Fall Poland. Wide-sweeping Agrarian reforms have already been planned, with great benefits for farmers in the region being chief among them. Podlachia can finally breathe again, as peace finally reaches the region."
