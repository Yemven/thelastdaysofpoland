unification.104.desc:0 "After the fall of Poland most people were concerned about the heavily damaged industry more than anything else, and especially more than agriculture. The leaders of PZ and AGROunia were different from most people, however, and they took it upon themselves to protect Polish farmers from damning foreign influence. \n\nThrough cooperation to topple the rival Podlachian government on their border which emerged after infighting concluded within the former voivodeship, and resolving internal issues, the People’s Union of Siedlce under Mateusz Piskorski came out on top, and now controls the entire Podlasie Voivodeship. \n\nHaving finally brought peace to Podlachia after years of strife, the PPU seeks to build a new Poland where agriculture and traditional values are respected. But before they can do that, they must conquer the remainder of Masovia and 14 voivodeships, which is undoubtedly next on their agenda"

unificationreg.104.desc:0 "What started off as a small clique in the town of Siedlce has become a major player in the ongoing Polish civil war, as the number of contenders keeps on decreasing. The ambitious Polish People’s Union had set their sights on former Ducal Prussia quite some time ago, and now they have triumphed. As a result, they now find themselves as one of the final contenders in this war.\n\nTheir hostility towards the Russians in Kaliningrad gives their many anti-Russian citizens a new hope that President Piskorski may prioritise Poland after all. Their dream is close to coming true, but the fight is not over yet. The PPU still needs to tackle their adversary to the south before they can even think about crossing the Vistula and unifying all Polish people under one banner. "

unificationsupreg.104.desc:0 "The former Podlachian People’s Union was a regionally powerful government, and now it’s on the road to becoming something more.\n\nTheir campaign against the various statelets in the northern part of the Masovian voivodeship was a great success, and as of now, the newly proclaimed Polish People’s Union controls all Mazovian land north of Warsaw, but they’re not going further south. The PPU is eyeing the lands up north, which are now divided between the Warmian-Masurian government and the government-in-exile of the Russian Federation. Of course, these two entities will not coexist peacefully for long, and the PPU government of Mateusz Piskorski seeks to exploit that by toppling both of them. Should they succeed, this campaign will be a turning point in the PPU’s short history."

super.59.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]A New, Agrarian Poland."
super.59.desc:0 "Surprising news rings out across all of Poland today, as the anarchy of the post-fall „warlord era” has finally come to an end, and the new government is one that promises change in an age of decay and stagnation. \n\nThe Polish People’s Union is an agrarian state which advocates for welfarism, preservation of culture and tradition, and calls for a patriotic attitude not only in foreign relations, but also in economic policy.\n\nNotably, the leader of this party, Mateusz Piskorski, is known for his strong pro-Russian sentiment, which has resulted in him gaining very little favour in the parts of the new Polish society opposed to Russia, of which there are many. But Piskorski isn’t the same man he was in 2027, and his worldview on many things has changed. As such, the future direction of Polish-Russian relations remains to be seen."
