unification.20.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]JWK Lubliniec unites Zagłębie and Jura"
unification.20.desc:0 "Fresh news from Zagłębie and Jura: The Military Commando Unit based in the town of Lubliniec has managed to dominate the entire region. Using the combined military might of the Commandos and the Territorial Defense Forces, a large yet inexperienced fighting force, they managed to restore order under a military administration. The general staff managed to wrangle the mess of a fighting force, though tensions between them were largely strained, with commandos and territorials often disregarding orders from their higherups’ counterparts, often leading to clashes between the two. Rumors also state that the General-Leader himself has been spending more and more time at libraries researching ancient strategies. Time will tell if this army with a state has a chance at survival, factoring in the deepening conflicts within power structures. Fractured as it may, JWK’s sheer firepower cannot be underestimated."
