 imported_mainframes_desc:"As the country rebuilds itself, and more and more elements of pre-Fall life return back, our political and academic spheres start to claw back to life, with academies and universities slowly filling back in and various small political notions evolving amongst people. By luring parts of intelligentsia back to our country, we can start to properly revert the brain drain in our lands."
 military_grade_computing:"Military-Grade Government Computing & Advanced Military Development Sectors"
 military_grade_computing_desc:"As we've evolved into a proper state, our need for computing power, room for data storage and a proper military development sector in the government has increased tenfold. By establishing an advanced governmental military R&D body and restoring the military-grade governmental computers that used to serve the old Polish gov, we can finally enter the Proper Government Club and start operating as a proper, established power in Central Europe."

 improvised_ballistic_computer:"Civilian-Grade Computers w/ Military Integration"
 improvised_ballistic_computer_desc:"We have barely any (if any at all) access to computers that whould allow us to use modern military vehicles and equipment - ergo, we have to resort to using normal, civilian computers that have been integrated with military tech, allowing us to use modern weapons or to use them as improvised onboard computers."
 ballistic_computer:"Cold War-Era Military Onboard Technology"
 ballistic_computer_desc:"Old military onboard computers (e.g. ballistic ones), radars, scanners and other toys that allows army boys to kill each other more effectively."
 modern_ballistic_computer:"Modern Military Onboard Technology"
 modern_ballistic_computer_desc:"G.I. Joe shit used by modern military weapon systems and vehicles, such as onboard computers, radars, guiding lasers, etc."

 improvised_radio:"Civilian Radio & Radar Technology"
 improvised_radio_desc:"As Poland vanished, so did most of its military infrastructure and equipment - most army facilities have been robbed clean or thrashed completely, leaving us only with civilian radios (usually household ones or old, portable ones used by fishing grandpas), walkie-takies used by kids and few civilian radars that usually serve single, very specific purposes. Thankfully, most cliques in Poland are as ragtag as us, so currently we're fine with civilian radios and radars that have been tinkered with to adapt them for army purposes."
 radio:0 "Cold War-Era Radio & Radar Technology"
 radio_desc:0 "With more proper military equipment in our hands, the need for purpose-made military devices increases, as much of our new equipment requires their functions to work, forcing us to acquire cheap, old radios, radars and other measurement and detection systems from abroad. New radios will make communication between various sectors of the army easier, and new detection devices will allow us to set up some proper (if VERY old by today's standards) defensive systems and intel acquisition systems on our turf, to further secure our hold over it."
 battlefield_management_systems:"Modern Battlefield Management Systems"
 battlefield_management_systems_desc:"A battlefield management system - BMS for short - is a system meant to integrate information acquisition and processing to enhance command and control of a military unit. Tech like this whould sharply increase our commandeering possibilities and the ease of acquiring data about the battlefield and the general terrain around it for both us AND for soldiers transmitting data to us."
 air_radio_control_1:0 "Rudimentary Aircraft Detection Techniques"
 air_radio_control_1_desc:0 "Improvised plane detection techniques consisting of browsing the web for information on nearby air traffic and the usage of modified, civilian radars as aircraft detectors."
 air_radio_control_2:0 "Improved Aircraft Detection Techniques"
 air_radio_control_2_desc:0 "Still provisionary, but improved in efficiency techniques of calculating the location of nearby enemy planes without proper army radars or other detection devices, such as knowledge on how to use images posted on the Internet to calculate enemy plane movement and which boards and sites are the best choices for gathering intel."
 air_radio_control_3:0 "Cold War-Era Air Radar"
 air_radio_control_3_desc:0 "Cheap military air radars that - given their age and Soviet origins - were probably used back in the Polish People's Army before getting sold and then bought back to Poland. Obviously, they're completely terrible compared to modern detection techniques."
 air_radio_control_4:0 "Modern Aircraft Detection Systems"
 air_radio_control_4_desc:0 "Modern military aircraft detection techniques and systems that help with detecting and dealing with most modern air vehicles used in armies."
 reconnecting_to_www:"Reconnecting to the Web"
 reconnecting_to_www_desc:"In order to grow our influence, enstreghten our agendas and make new connections with powerful people and factions, we need to establish a social media presence that will appeal to useful idiots such as jaded millenials, 12 year old redditors and weirdos enhabiting various imageboards. That way our voice and cause can be heard across the whole world, and as the whole world will start to talk about us more often and more loudly, people in Poland will also be swayed to our side more easily."
 basic_opsec:"Basic OpSec"
 basic_opsec_desc:"Rule #1: DO NOT TALK ABOUT OUR PLANS, GOALS AND LOCATIONS \nRule #2: CHECK WHAT'S IN THE BACKGROUND OF PHOTOS TAKEN BY YOU \nRule #3: DO NOT CLICK SHADY LINKS OR RUN SHADY PROGRAMS \nRule #4: IF YOURE ABOVE 45 YEARS OLD, LET THE YOUNGSTERS OPERATE YOUR COMPUTER, BECAUSE TEACHING YOU HOW TO USE A COMPUTER WILL BE WAY TOO DIFFICULT \nRule #5: DO NOT BROWSE PORN ON COMPUTERS BELONGING TO GOVERNMENT BODIES"
 vpn_and_tor:"VPNs & Onion Routing"
 vpn_and_tor_desc:"To further secure our data, we can employ cheaply available civilian-grade encryption techniques, such as using VPNs and onion routing. A proper government whould still have an easy time finding our Internet activity, but for Polish standards such measures will be more than enough. \n\nNow comes the hard part, however: how do we teach 60 years old clerks on how to use Tor?"
 not_pegasus:"Spyware & Cyber-Surveillance"
 not_pegasus_desc:"Back in the day when Poland existed, it's government employed Pegasus for surveilling opposition groups. Whatever our stance on governmental spyware is, we cannot deny that it whould come in handy, and it whould be highly useful for national security and espionage purposes. We can sacrifice some money to buy one of these spyware programs and deploy them to spy on enemy cliques. Or our own citizens."
 military_grade_encryption:"Military-Grade Encryption"
 military_grade_encryption_desc:"Proper, military-grade encryption used by governments and armies of the 21st century. With security like this, no amateur will be able to hijack our data and listen to our secret meetings."
 adhoc_trollbrigades:"Ad Hoc Troll Brigades"
 adhoc_trollbrigades_desc:"Cold War has ruined the public image of wars. World order set in 2001 started to break down and now people start to thirst for blood of others once more, yet war is still percieved as an ugly, and - most importantly - a very unnecessary thing. Because of that, every modern country that gets into conflicts with others employs internet trolls to sway people to their side and cover any mishaps that happened while they were enforcing their will upon others. We should do the same - let's recruit some people to start spreading propaganda in social media to turn people against our enemies and to make ourselves look better in their eyes."
 internet_troll_agencies:"Professional Troll Brigades"
 internet_troll_agencies_desc:"Amateurish trolls can be useful, but over time people start to realise they're just shouting things on the Internet. Professional troll agencies, however, are able to sow so much disinformation and chaos in the Web to affect politics in other countries and create loyalists that support foreign regimes with their lives despite never having any contact with them or their countries. The past Russian government has mastered this technique, employing internet troll farms to dictate how anti-American politics are conducted on the Internet, and we should establish similar troll cells in our government to sow foreign support for our cause."
 ai_trollbots:"AI Trollbots & Troll Brigades"
 ai_trollbots_desc:"The early '20s were a period of major development of machine learning bots. Bots of all kinds - image-creating bots, chat bots, and of course - trollbots. Trollbots that were fed with so many data samples, that they were almost able to pass the Turing test, as shown by a bot fed with samples from /pol/ that managed to fool many 4chan users into thinking that it's a real person. Over years, more and more such bots were employed by troll farms to spread agendas over the Internet, therefore, to increase the effeciency of our troll agencies, we should start investing into bots (let's start with simple ones) helping with sowing chaos in Internet discourses."
 advanced_ai_trollbots:"Professionally-Made AI Trollbots & Troll Brigades"
 advanced_ai_trollbots_desc:"An advanced, machine-learning algorythm - a perfect propaganda machine, that lures edgy American teenargers and 'woke' horoscope-reading spiritualists into sacrificing their hearts and minds for an agenda that was made up by a bunch of old men fighting a war in Central Europe. If we were to find the right person that could create a bot like this for our purposes, our government's trolls could multiply the effectiveness and the reach of our troll agencies by tenfolds and potentially creating a permament mark in Internet politics and worldviews."
