POLITICS_MATEUSZ_MORAWIECKI_DESC:0 "It’s hard to admit you’ve done something wrong – especially if everything went wrong. Mateusz Morawiecki, fortunately, has more than enough of other factors to blame. \n\nOf course, the opposition would be first on that list. It has been relieving to see them drop their masks, standing tall over native population as alienated oppressors, backed by European military might. His party colleagues would be next – they’ve been mental adolescents, like Duda, madmen, like Macierewicz, psychopaths, like Ziobro, or just Sasin, like Sasin. Leftists and right-wing extremists emerged from beneath the ground like cockroaches, ready to feast on the carcass. And the bomb – Morawiecki really did learn to stop worrying and love it. For the bomb has the power to make anyone forget. \n\nTaxes, alarming illegalism, nepotism and incompetence, more taxes, inflation, sugar tax, reckless social spending, rising VAT rates, Catholic bigotry, throttling minorities, a few more taxes – all these things fade in the memory with every day with Morawiecki still in power. Although exiled from the capital, Morawiecki represents the continued existence of the legal government, and has by far the greatest legitimacy among all states in Poland. Holding fast to power, Morawiecki hasn’t given up his plans for the development of Poland. He knows Poland and the Poles well, and now, when there’s so little to lose, he will employ this knowledge to the fullest. Law and Justice will prevail, one way or the other. \n\nAt least he won’t have to visit Bałuty this time."
