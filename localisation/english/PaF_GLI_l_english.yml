unification.24.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Gliwice unify Upper Silesia!"
unification.24.desc:0 "Not everything that is written is true, but for Szczepan Twardoch, it might as well be. Or at least that's what he wished it would be. Despite this, Twardoch definitely became the most popular Silesian writer, but he decided to turn this popularity into political capital, out of hatred for the political entity called the Third Republic of Poland.\n\nThe shafts of the Silesian mines resounded with a thunderous roar as the Silesian nation threw off its shackles, but not everyone was happy about it. Those who were not Silesians could only rejoice at the thought of the upcoming forced trip to the mine. Especially now, when the Silesian poet has come to lead the entire Silesian metropolis, he must decide whether he wants to be a despot persecuting everything that is Polish, or whether he will decide to build a bridge to reconcile the two feuding nations and the historical Polish-Silesian union."
