 POLITICS_JACEK_SASIN_DESC:0 "Jacek Sasin claimed he would organize envelope elections for 70 million złoty. \n\nHe said that the 2025 elections were perfectly free and just. \n\nHe claimed that unrest would go away in about a week. \n\nHe dismissed with laughter the possibility of EU intervention. \n\nHe argued that the nuclear explosion in Poland is pure fantasy. \n\nHe boasted Warsaw barricades are tough enough to hold off any attacker. \n\nHe promised he’ll take Jarosław Kaczyński to a place where he would be safe and sound. \n\nNow Sasin is hiding in Ciechanów, having fled Morawiecki’s government. There, to make a semblance of legal authority, he was made Protector of Northern Mazovia. It would be an over-exaggeration to claim that anyone expects much from him. However, Sasin’s morale is as strong as ever. He briskly began to work, and despite overflowing with optimism, he stated his personal opinion humbly: he won’t be the one to unite Poland again. \n\n§RMay he for once be right§!."

unification.55.desc:0 "A gasp of disbelief and apprehension rolls though the country as government of Ostrołęka started streaming an empty stage in the city park with a banner above proclaiming „Reunification of Northern Mazovia Region”. After approximately half an hour the stream was raided by trolls and taken down, but the message remained. \nA splintover of the remnant government, Jacek Sasin’s authority wasn’t expected to last long. However, due to some trick of fate, it survived all other statelets, perhaps because they did not expect any sort of threat on its behalf. Some former opponents reevaluated what they thought about Sasin and admitted, albeit reluctantly, that he proved a shrewd and cunning politician. \nAs eyes turn on Ostrołęka, there has been further confusion and anxiety as Sasin ceased correspondence with other warlords. Trusted sources claim he halted the flow of letters after almost signing the document which proved to be an act of annexation by Czech Republic."
