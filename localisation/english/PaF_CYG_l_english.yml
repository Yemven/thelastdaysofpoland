unification.60.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Gypsy State unifies Lower Silesia"
unification.60.desc:0 "We are getting rumors of an unusual event. The Romani, who had won their self-determination after the fall of Poland, united the lands of Lower Silesia. The Romani people fought fiercely for their future more than once, and the same had happened this time. Now that they have secured the former voivodeship, their tabors can safely traverse these lands.\n\nManaged by the king, under the very strong influence of the council of elders, the state begins to stabilize the region and take steps towards securing the nation's future in such uncertain times. As minority rule with a strong class division is difficult to maintain, especially among hot-blooded Poles, the state faces a real problem. With the help of brave warriors who suppress any sign of disobedience, as well as the methods of amusing citizens through great carnivals full of wine and dancing, it maybe can succeed and exist for a longer time."
unification.60.a:0 "How did that even happen?"
