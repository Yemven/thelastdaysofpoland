JOM_ny_saga_desc: "A few months ago Halfdan Sandbjerg was just a prisoner in EK Westpolen, treated inhumanely for his beliefs, but no more. Thanks to the local partisans he managed to escape and moved to Bornholm to once again work towards the liberation of the Poles."
JOM_tyr_chosen_desc: "His failure teached him one thing: there is no victory without strength, but there is no strength within the modern left, so he decided to seek it elsewhere. Soon he found groups of brutal lunatics that needed only one thing to be useful: a true leader."
JOM_marxist_vanguard_desc: "Revolutionaries believe that a better world can be achieved through a bloodshed led by an enlightened leader. They are fools to think that such concentration of power will not corrupt them. But now Halfdan needs all the mad dogs he can gather for his great plan. He will deal with them later"
JOM_first_divisions_desc: "Who would have thought that vikings and communists would quarrel and fight with each other before they will achieve anything? Well at least these things aren't new for a leftist politician."
JOM_who_am_i_desc: "All of these happened so quickly… I made something horrible, but at last I'm able to bring a true change. If I gained this due to madness, then maybe madness is a way to go?"
JOM_what_am_i_doing_desc: "What have I done? I shattered all my ideas for lust for power that clouded my mind for past months. It can't be! Maybe I am the one that needs help?"
JOM_intruders_desc: "The Danish government is not aware of our plans or the scale of our forces and it has to stay that way. Catch anybody who saw our camp!"
JOM_inland_contacts_desc: "The partisans that freed Sandbjerg are probably still active. We must contact them and any other rebel organizations to bring chaos to ensure a success of our invasion"
JOM_thousand_drakkars_desc: "Our forces will not magically spawn in Poland, so we need a fleet to move from there and unfortunately the only way to get one lies in local forests."
JOM_begin_the_revolution_desc: "Brothers and comrades, the time has come! Our war against lies, war against injustice, war against oppressors can finally begin! No longer will we bow before masters, no longer will we get deceived by stories of mercy and salvation. Now our actions will define ourselves and show who we truly are!"

JOM_althing_desc: "Our first victory over capitalist tyrants was swift and flawless, but now we have to lay the foundations for the future state"
JOM_social_care_debate_desc: "The citizens of EK Westpolen were ruthlessly exploited to feed their German masters. Finally fruits of their labor will be fairly distributed among them."
JOM_state_development_debate_desc: "Due to recent havoc many cities in Western Pomerania lie in ruins, without any perspective to return to their former glory. Our hardest task will be to bring hope and help wherever it will be needed."
JOM_armed_forces_debate_desc: "Our army consists of crazy LARP vikings and undisciplined squats - while it was enough at the beginning, now we will need a true regular army to fight and expand."
JOM_cultural_revolution_debate_desc: "Our main goal was, is and always will be to bring change and create a better society that is open, tolerant and egalitarian."
JOM_state_secularity_debate_desc: "Catholic church is an archenemy of socialism, forces of reaction, capitalists, autocrats and psychopaths always flocked to it. Our holy task is to destroy it and bring revenge for centuries of oppression!"
JOM_help_the_citizens_desc: "Poverty among our population runs rampant. If we want to keep them content we have to create a new support system for the poorest that will give us time to reform the society."
JOM_health_and_environment_desc: "A man needs something more than just money to have a long and happy life. He needs clean air, parks, places where he can relax and not think about the cruelty of our world."

jomsborg.3.desc:0 "Every few days, more news about EKW's downfall reach us. Today's news, however, have been... quite unorthodox. Apparently, Pomeranian regional media are informing about... a Viking raid on Kamień Pomorski. \n\nThe norsemen were led by Adrian Zandberg (apparently referred to as Halfdan Sandbjerg by his men), whom it looks like have finally returned back to the country after his exodus to Bornholm following the conflict between him and the Eurokommissariat's government. After his public denunciations of EKs' inner patologies and shady deals ultimately resulted in his arrest and a police raid on his house, Zandberg made a speech on how not even the EU is able to save the failed concept that is Poland, and that in order to build a respectable state, Polish identity as a whole needs to be replaced with a more noble, Nordic one."

##Characters##
POLITICS_HALFDAN_SANDBJERG_DESC:0 "There was a man who dreamt of a better Poland. Of social justice and equality. Of a peaceful struggle for rights and against exploitation. This man navigated carefully in the sea of politics, trying to balance the needs of people and requirements of liberal democracy. All these efforts proved to be in vain. \n\nThe EU intervention, seeming auspicious at first, brought nothing but further misery to Poland. The gates to a just, equitable European society were just as before, closed shut. Adrian Zandberg began to criticize the occupational government, and the angry masses heeded his words too eagerly. Tusk ordered his imprisonment and handed him over to some of the most despicable thugs he could foster. Zandberg never disclosed the details, but he escaped the prison as a different man. \n\nHe got to the shores of Bornholm and gazed upon the sea. He ran from beyond the sea, yes, but his origins were here, in the North. His blood boiled, his soul yearned for revenge. What good was there in the constant squabbling and striving to bring forward a civil, non-violent popular change? He was the survivor, the warrior, the Northman - a Viking. If Poland has failed to become a fair, humane country, that's too bad for Poland. \n\nSandbjerg wants to start with an axe and end with a helping hand. The redistribution of wealth can be done by force alone, and Sandbjerg draws it from many sources - starting from deranged neopagans, through disillusioned revolutionaries, ending on radicalized social democrats; whoever willing to fight will get their share. There is no simple answer to whether this is an unorthodox interpretation of socialism or simple warlordism, although time will bring an answer to that query. \n\nFor now, §0the storm is coming from the north, and the Poles are going to wither.§!"
